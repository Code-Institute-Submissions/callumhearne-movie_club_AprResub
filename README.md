Film Club is a website where my friends and I are able to review films and give our personal opinions on them.

The idea to create the film club website came from my dad. He does a film club of his own with his friends where they go to see films and talk about them in their whatsapp group. I thought it would be better and easier to make a website that displayed the reviews better and more clear while also being more accessible.

This is my third of four milestone projects that make up my Full Stack Web Development course at THE CODE INSTITUTE. The main requirements are to make a responsive website with HTML5, CSS3, Java Script, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

Here is the link to my live website : 

# UX

- To provide a easier experience for the users to submit reviews on films they have watched.
- To allow users to be able to browse through reviews easily and efficiently.
- To create a responsive website that can be used on tablets and phones.
- To create a website that can be navigated easily and not being difficult to use so that the user is not frustrated.

# User Stories

## New Users

- I am a new user who wanted to be able to post my film reviews and see if I had similar thoughts on films as others did.
- I am a new user who was looking at other websites to see reviews on with a good search engine to be able to see reviews quick and easy.

## Returning User

- I am a returning user who wants to be able to edit their reviews and chnage scores on repeat viewings of the film.
- I am a returning user who wants to be able to delete their reviews if the review feels outdated.

## Tablet User

- I am a tablet user and I was able to use the website fine on my tablet.

# Design Procces

1. Strategy plane : When planning on what I wanted my film club website, I wanted to make a website that was easy to navigate and clear and representing the information that the website was presenting. I didn't want the website to be complicated and be user friendly. I asked a few friends and family one what would be a suitable display and theme to meet these goals.

2. Scope plane : Now that I had planned what I was going to do with my website, I then needed to plan what sort of features I wanted to add to the website. For the reviews I decided to make clear buttons to edit and delete my reviews. I also made a search function so that I was able to search through the reviews. I made a page to manage the genres so that I was able to create and remove genres for the films. I also added an a profile page so that I could see my reviews.

3. Structure plane : For the structure of the website my first made it so that the user will encounter the login and register page before going into the rest of the site. From there the user will be able to access the reviews and there profile.

5. Surface plane :
