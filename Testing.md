Testing

The testing process I went through is listed below:
- Testing user stories.
- Validating the code.
- Checking if the website is repsonsive.
- Manually testing the websites features.

Testing user stories

New users :
- This user is able to do exaclty what they asked, they are able create reviews and see other reviews. 
- The user is able to search through each review using a filter being able to searchfor genre, author or film name.
Returing users:
- Returing users are able to edit their reviews which is what the user wanted.
- Returing users are able to delete their own reviews if they don't like them which is what the user wanted. 
Tablet user:
- The website is fully repsonsive on tablets and phones so this user will be able to use the website fine.
